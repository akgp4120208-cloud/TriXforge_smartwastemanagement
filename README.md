# TriXforge_smartwastemanagement
IoT and AI-powered smart waste management solution for optimized waste collection and disposal.

# Smart Waste Management System using IoT and AI

## 💡 Idea Overview
Our project aims to create a smart waste management system that uses IoT sensors and AI-based analytics to improve waste collection efficiency.  

## 🚮 Problem
Unmanaged waste bins often overflow, leading to unhygienic surroundings and inefficient collection routes.

## 🤖 Solution
We propose installing IoT sensors in garbage bins to monitor waste levels and send real-time data to a central system.  
AI algorithms will analyze the data and predict optimal waste collection routes and schedules.

## ⚙️ Technologies Planned
- **IoT:** Ultrasonic sensors, NodeMCU/Arduino  
- **AI:** Data analytics for route prediction  
- **Cloud:** Firebase / AWS for data storage  
- **Frontend:** Simple dashboard for monitoring

## 🎯 Expected Outcome
A cleaner, more efficient, and automated waste management process that helps cities stay smart and sustainable.
